Udemy Milestone Project -  Tic Tac toe

Currently only works as a two player game. This is the first milestone project for the Udemy Python Bootcamp course.

Instructions:

python tictactoe.py

Word of caution: It still doesn't work quite right... the game needs to be turned in to a function that runs once per player, instead of repeating the code.
